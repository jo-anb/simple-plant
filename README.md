This is an extention on the [simple-plant](https://github.com/ndesgranges/simple-plant-card) integration from @ndesgranges.
It includes more settings for your plant management. With this integration you can set:
- Fertilization options
- Cleaning options
- Misting options
- Plant ulimination requirements

I also extended the [simple-plant-card](https://github.com/ndesgranges/simple-plant-card) card from @ndesgranges to include these new components in the card.
See the card repo, [simple-plant-extended-card](https://github.com/jo-anb/simple-plant-extended-card)
